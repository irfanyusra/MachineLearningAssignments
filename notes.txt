Classification problems: 
- Logistical regression: 
--- used for data that can be seperated using a line 
--- finds a linear decision boundary
--- ex2.py
- Regularized logistic regression
--- A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will appear nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot.
--- susceptible to over fitting
